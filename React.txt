🟦 1. React Fundamentals

What is React

Virtual DOM

Fiber architecture

JSX

Components (function + class)

Props

State

Rendering logic

Conditional rendering

Lists & keys

Reconciliation

Pure components

🟩 2. React Lifecycle (Class + Function Equivalent)
Class Components

Mounting (constructor, getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount)

Updating (shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate)

Unmounting (componentWillUnmount)

Error boundaries (getDerivedStateFromError, componentDidCatch)

Functional Equivalent

useEffect lifecycle mapping

useLayoutEffect mapping

🟧 3. Event System (Fully Covered)

Synthetic events

Event bubbling

Event capturing

onClickCapture

stopPropagation

preventDefault

Passing event handlers

Event delegation

🟨 4. Hooks (Every Single Hook)
Core Hooks

useState

useEffect

useRef

useContext

Performance Hooks

useMemo

useCallback

Advanced Hooks

useReducer

useLayoutEffect

useImperativeHandle

useDebugValue

useDeferredValue

useTransition

useId

useSyncExternalStore

Custom Hooks

Reusable logic patterns

Debounce / Throttle hook

Fetch hook

LocalStorage hook

🟪 5. Component Patterns

Controlled components

Uncontrolled components

Higher Order Components (HOC)

Render props

Compound components

Provider pattern

Smart vs dumb components

Container + Presenter

Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs

Context-driven components

🟥 6. Forms

Basics of forms in React

Controlled inputs

useRef forms (uncontrolled)

Form handling patterns

Form validation (Yup, Zod)

Libraries:

🟦 7. State Management
Local State

Basic useState

Derived state

Lifting state up

Global State

Context

useReducer

🟩 8. Routing (React Router v6+)

Basic Routing

Nested Routes

Dynamic Routes

Search Params (useSearchParams)

Loader + Action (RR Data API)

Protected routes

Redirects

Layout routes

🟧 9. Data Fetching

Fetch API

Axios

🟥 12. Error Handling

try/catch in components

Error boundaries

Fallback UI

Graceful API error handling

🟦 13. Context API (In-depth)

When to use
